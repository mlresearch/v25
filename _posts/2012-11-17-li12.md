title: Active Learning with Hinted Support Vector Machine
abstract: The abundance of real-world data and limited labeling budget calls for active
  learning, which is an important learning paradigm for reducing human labeling efforts.
  Many recently developed active learning algorithms consider both uncertainty and
  representativeness when making querying decisions. However, exploiting representativeness
  with uncertainty concurrently usually requires tackling sophisticated and challenging
  learning tasks, such as clustering. In this paper, we propose a new active learning
  framework, called hinted sampling, which takes both uncertainty and representativeness
  into account in a simpler way. We design a novel active learning algorithm within
  the hinted sampling framework with an extended support vector machine. Experimental
  results validate that the novel active learning algorithm can result in a better
  and more stable performance than that achieved by state-of-the-art algorithms.
