title: Variational Bayesian Matching
abstract: Matching of samples refers to the problem of inferring unknown co-occurrence
  or alignment between observations in two data sets. Given two sets of equally many
  samples, the task is to find for each sample a representative sample in the other
  set, without prior knowledge on a distance measure between the sets. Recently a
  few alternative solutions have been suggested, based on maximization of joint likelihood
  or various measures of between-data statistical dependency. In this work we present
  an variational Bayesian solution for the problem, learning a Bayesian canonical
  correlation analysis model with a permutation parameter for re-ordering the samples
  in one of the sets. We approximate the posterior over the permutations, and demonstrate
  that the resulting matching algorithm clearly outperforms all of the earlier solutions.
