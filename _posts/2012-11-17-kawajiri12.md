title: Frustratingly Simplified Deployment in WLAN Localization by Learning from Route
  Annotation
abstract: 'Recently wireless LAN (WLAN) localization systems are gaining popularity
  in pervasive computing, machine learning and sensor networks communities, especially
  indoor scenarios where GPS coverage is limited. To accurately predict location,
  a large amount of fingerprints composed of received signal strength values is necessary.
  Moreover, standard supervised or semi-supervised approaches also require location
  information to each fingerprint, where annotation work is rather tedious and time
  consuming. To reduce the efforts and time required to build calibration data, we
  present a novel calibration methodology \route-annotation‚Äù and a self-training algorithm
  for learning from route information effectively. On the proposed calibration methodology,
  an annotator walks around while measuring fingerprints, then occasionally stops
  to annotate fingerprints with route from previous location to current location.
  This calibration reduces work time even compared to partially annotation, while
  routes have richer information for learning. The proposed learning algorithm comprises
  following two iterative steps: 1) inferring locations of each fingerprint under
  route constraints and 2) updating parameters. Experimental results on real-world
  datasets demonstrate learning from route-annotated data is comparable to state-of-the-art
  supervised and semi-supervised approaches trained with large amount of calibration
  data.'
