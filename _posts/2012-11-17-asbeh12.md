title: Learning Latent Variable Models by Pairwise Cluster Comparison
abstract: Identification of latent variables that govern a problem and the relationships
  among them given measurements in the observed world are important for causal discovery.
  This identification can be made by analyzing constraints imposed by the latents
  in the measurements. We introduce the concept of pairwise cluster comparison PCC
  to identify causal relationships from clusters and a two-stage algorithm, called
  LPCC, that learns a latent variable model (LVM) using PCC. First, LPCC learns the
  exogenous and the collider latents, as well as their observed descendants, by utilizing
  pairwise comparisons between clusters in the measurement space that may explain
  latent causes. Second, LPCC learns the non-collider endogenous latents and their
  children by splitting these latents from their previously learned latent ancestors.
  LPCC is not limited to linear or latent-tree models and does not make assumptions
  about the distribution. Using simulated and real-world datasets, we show that LPCC
  improves accuracy with the sample size, can learn large LVMs, and is accurate in
  learning compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.
