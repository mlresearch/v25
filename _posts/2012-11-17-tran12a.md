title: Cumulative Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Ordinal Matrix Data Analysis
abstract: Ordinal data is omnipresent in almost all multiuser-generated feedback -
  questionnaires, preferences etc. This paper investigates modelling of ordinal data
  with Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). In particular, we present the
  model architecture, learning and inference procedures for both vector-variate and
  matrix-variate ordinal data. We show that our model is able to capture latent opinion
  profile of citizens around the world, and is competitive against state-of-art collaborative
  filtering techniques on large-scale public datasets. The model thus has the potential
  to extend application of RBMs to diverse domains such as recommendation systems,
  product reviews and expert assessments.
