title: Learning and Model-Checking Networks of I/O Automata
abstract: We introduce a new statistical relational learning (SRL) approach in which
  models for structured data, especially network data, are constructed as networks
  of communicating finite probabilistic automata. Leveraging existing automata learning
  methods from the area of grammatical inference, we can learn generic models for
  network entities in the form of automata templates. As is characteristic for SRL
  techniques, the abstraction level afforded by learning generic templates enables
  one to apply the learned model to new domains. A main benefit of learning models
  based on finite automata lies in the fact that one can analyse the resulting models
  using formal model-checking techniques, which adds a dimension of model analysis
  not usually available for traditional SRL modeling frameworks.
