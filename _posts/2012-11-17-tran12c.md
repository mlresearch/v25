title: Two-way Parallel Class Expression Learning
abstract: In machine learning, we often encounter datasets that can be described using
  simple rules and regular exception patterns describing situations where those rules
  do not apply. In this paper, we propose a two-way parallel class expression learning
  algorithm that is suitable for this kind of problem. This is a top-down refinement-based
  class expression learning algorithm for Description Logic (DL). It is distinguished
  from similar DL learning algorithms in the way it uses the concepts generated by
  the refinement operator. In our approach, we unify the computation of concepts describing
  positive and negative examples, but we maintain them separately, and combine them
  at the end. By doing so, we can avoid the use of negation in the refinement without
  any loss of generality. Evaluation shows that our approach can reduce the search
  space significantly, and therefore the learning time is reduced. Our implementation
  is based on the DL-Learner framework and we inherit the Parallel Class Expression
  Learning (ParCEL) algorithm design for parallelisation.
