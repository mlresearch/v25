title: Learning Temporal Association Rules on Symbolic Time Sequences
abstract: We introduce a temporal pattern model called Temporal Interval Tree Association
  Rules (Tita rules or Titar). This pattern model can express both uncertainty and
  temporal inaccuracy of temporal events. Among other things, Tita rules can express
  the usual time point operators, synchronicity, order, and chaining, as well as temporal
  negation and disjunctive temporal constraints. Using this representation, we present
  the Titar learner algorithm that can be used to extract Tita rules from large datasets
  expressed as Symbolic Time Sequences. The selection of temporal constraints (or
  time-frames) is at the core of the temporal learning. Our learning algorithm is
  based on two novel approaches for this problem. This first one is designed to select
  temporal constraints for the head of temporal association rules. The second selects
  temporal constraints for the body of such rules. We discuss the evaluation of probabilistic
  temporal association rules, evaluate our technique with two experiments, introduce
  a metric to evaluate sets of temporal rules, compare the results with two other
  approaches and discuss the results.
