title: Conditional validity of inductive conformal predictors
abstract: Conformal predictors are set predictors that are automatically valid in
  the sense of having coverage probability equal to or exceeding a given confidence
  level. Inductive conformal predictors are a computationally efficient version of
  conformal predictors satisfying the same property of validity. However, inductive
  conformal predictors have been only known to control unconditional coverage probability.
  This paper explores various versions of conditional validity and various ways to
  achieve them using inductive conformal predictors and their modifications.
