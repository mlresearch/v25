title: Multi-objective Monte-Carlo Tree Search
abstract: Concerned with multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL), this paper
  presents MO-MCTS, an extension of Monte-Carlo Tree Search to multi-objective sequential
  decision making. The known multi-objective indicator referred to as hyper-volume
  indicator is used to define an action selection criterion, replacing the UCB criterion
  in order to deal with multi-dimensional rewards. MO-MCTS is firstly compared with
  an existing MORL algorithm on the artificial Deep Sea Treasure problem. Then a scalability
  study of MO-MCTS is made on the NP-hard problem of grid scheduling, showing that
  the performance of MO-MCTS matches the non RL-based state of the art albeit with
  a higher computational cost.
