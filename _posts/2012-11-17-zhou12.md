title: Multi-view Positive and Unlabeled Learning
abstract: Learning with Positive and Unlabeled instances (PU learning) arises widely
  in information retrieval applications. To address the unavailability issue of negative
  instances, most existing PU learning approaches require to either identify a reliable
  set of negative instances from the unlabeled data or estimate probability densities
  as an intermediate step. However, inaccurate negative-instance identification or
  poor density estimation may severely degrade overall performance of the final predictive
  model. To this end, we propose a novel PU learning method based on density ratio
  estimation without constructing any sets of negative instances or estimating any
  intermediate densities. To further boost PU learning performance, we extend our
  proposed learning method in a multi-view manner by utilizing multiple heterogeneous
  sources. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
  methods, especially when positive labeled data are limited.
