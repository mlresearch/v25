title: Sparse Additive Matrix Factorization for Robust PCA and Its Generalization
abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) can be regarded as approximating a data
  matrix with a low-rank one by imposing sparsity on its singular values, and its
  robust variant further captures sparse noise. In this paper, we extend such sparse
  matrix learning methods, and propose a novel unified framework called sparse additive
  matrix factorization (SAMF). SAMF systematically induces various types of sparsity
  by the so-called model-induced regularization in the Bayesian framework. We propose
  an iterative algorithm called the mean update (MU) for the variational Bayesian
  approximation to SAMF, which gives the global optimal solution for a large subset
  of parameters in each step. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on artificial
  data and the foreground/background video separation.
