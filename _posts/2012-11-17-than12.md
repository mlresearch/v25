title: Supervised dimension reduction with topic models
abstract: We consider supervised dimension reduction (SDR) for problems with discrete
  variables. Existing methods are computationally expensive, and often do not take
  the local structure of data into consideration when searching for a low-dimensional
  space. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for SDR which is (1) general
  and fiexible so that it can be easily adapted to various unsupervised topic models,
  (2) able to inherit scalability of unsupervised topic models, and (3) can exploit
  well label information and local structure of data when searching for a new space.
  Extensive experiments with adaptations to three models demonstrate that our framework
  can yield scalable and qualitative methods for SDR. One of those adaptations can
  perform better than the state-of-the-art method for SDR while enjoying significantly
  faster speed.
