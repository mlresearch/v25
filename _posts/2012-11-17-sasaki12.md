title: Topographic Analysis of Correlated Components
abstract: 'Independent component analysis (ICA) is a method to estimate components
  which are as statistically independent as possible. However, in many practical applications,
  the estimated components are not independent. Recent variants of ICA have made use
  of such residual dependencies to estimate an ordering (topography) of the components.
  Like in ICA, the components in those variants are assumed to be uncorrelated, which
  might be a rather strict condition. In this paper, we address this shortcoming.
  We propose a generative model for the source where the components can have linear
  and higher order correlations, which generalizes models in use so far. Based on
  the model, we derive a method to estimate topographic representations. In numerical
  experiments on artificial data, the new method is shown to be more widely applicable
  than previously proposed extensions of ICA. We learn topographic representations
  for two kinds of real data sets: for outputs of simulated complex cells in the primary
  visual cortex and for text data.'
