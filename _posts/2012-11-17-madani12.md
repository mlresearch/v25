title: On Using Nearly-Independent Feature Families for High Precision and Confidence
abstract: Often we require classification at a very high precision level, such as
  99%. We report that when very different sources of evidence such as text, audio,
  and video features are available, combining the outputs of base classifiers trained
  on each feature type separately, aka late fusion, can substantially increase the
  recall of the combination at high precisions, compared to the performance of a single
  classifier trained on all the feature types i.e.,Â early fusion, or compared to the
  individual base classifiers. We show how the probability of a joint false-positive
  mistake can be upper bounded by the product of individual probabilities of conditional
  false-positive mistakes, by identifying a simple key criterion that needs to hold.
  This provides an explanation for the high precision phenomenon, and motivates referring
  to such feature families as (nearly) independent. We assess the relevant factors
  for achieving high precision empirically, and explore combination techniques informed
  by the analysis. We compare a number of early and late fusion methods, and observe
  that classifier combination via late fusion can more than double the recall at high
  precision.
