title: Learning From Ordered Sets and Applications in Collaborative Ranking
abstract: 'Ranking over sets arise when users choose between groups of items. For
  example, a group may be of those movies deemed 5 stars to them, or a customized
  tour package. It turns out, to model this data type properly, we need to investigate
  the general combinatorics problem of partitioning a set and ordering the subsets.
  Here we construct a probabilistic log-linear model over a set of ordered subsets.
  Inference in this combinatorial space is highly challenging: The space size approaches
  (N!=2)6:93145^N+1 as N approaches infinity. We propose a split-and-merge Metropolis-Hastings
  procedure that can explore the state-space efficiently. For discovering hidden aspects
  in the data, we enrich the model with latent binary variables so that the posteriors
  can be efficiently evaluated. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model on large-scale
  collaborative filtering tasks and demonstrate that it is competitive against state-of-the-art
  methods.'
