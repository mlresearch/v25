title: Online Learning of a Dirichlet Process Mixture of Generalized Dirichlet Distributions
  for Simultaneous Clustering and Localized Feature Selection
abstract: Online algorithms allow data instances to be processed in a sequential way,
  which is important for large-scale and real-time applications. In this paper, we
  propose a novel online clustering approach based on a Dirichlet process mixture
  of generalized Dirichlet (GD) distributions, which can be considered as an extension
  of the finite GD mixture model to the infinite case. Our approach is built on nonparametric
  Bayesian analysis where the determination of the number of clusters is sidestepped
  by assuming an infinite number of mixture components. Moreover, an unsupervised
  localized feature selection scheme is integrated with the proposed nonparametric
  framework to improve the clustering performance. By learning the proposed model
  in an online manner using a variational approach, all the involved parameters and
  features saliencies are estimated simultaneously and effectively in closed forms.
  The proposed online infinite mixture model is validated through both synthetic data
  sets and two challenging real-world applications namely text document clustering
  and online human face detection.
