title: A Coupled Indian Buffet Process Model for Collaborative Filtering
abstract: The dramatic rates new digital content becomes available has brought collaborative
  filtering systems in the epicenter of computer science research in the last decade.
  In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for rating prediction utilizing concepts
  from the field of Bayesian nonparametrics. The basic concept that underlies our
  approach is that each user rates a presented item based on the latent genres of
  the item and the latent interests of the user. Each item may belong to more than
  one genre, and each user may belong to more than one latent interest class. The
  number of existing latent genres and interests are not known beforehand, but should
  be inferred in a data-driven fashion. We devise a novel hierarchical factor analysis
  model to formulate our approach under these assumptions. We impose suitable priors
  over the allocation of items into genres, and users into interests; specifically,
  we utilize a novel scheme which comprises two coupled Indian buffet process priors
  that allow the number of latent classes (genres/interests) to be automatically inferred.
  We experiment on a large set of real ratings data, and show that our approach outperforms
  four common baselines, including two very competitive state-of-the-art approaches.
