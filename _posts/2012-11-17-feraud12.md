title: A stochastic bandit algorithm for scratch games
abstract: Stochastic multi-armed bandit algorithms are used to solve the exploration
  and exploitation dilemma in sequential optimization problems. The algorithms based
  on upper confidence bounds offer strong theoretical guarantees, they are easy to
  implement and efficient in practice. We considers a new bandit setting, called \scratch-games",
  where arm budgets are limited and reward are drawn without replacement. Using Serfling
  inequality, we propose an upper confidence bound algorithm adapted to this setting.
  We show that the bound of expectation to play a suboptimal arm is lower than the
  one of UCB1 policy. We illustrate this result on both synthetic problems and realistic
  problems (ad-serving and emailing campaigns optimization).
