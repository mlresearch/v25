title: Improved sequence classification using adaptive segmental sequence alignment
abstract: Traditional pairwise sequence alignment is based on matching individual
  samples from two sequences, under time monotonicity constraints. However, in some
  instances matching two segments of points may be preferred and can result in increased
  noise robustness. This paper presents an approach to segmental sequence alignment
  based on adaptive pairwise segmentation. We introduce a distance metric between
  segments based on average pairwise distances, which addresses deficiencies of prior
  approaches. We then present a modified pair-HMM that incorporates the proposed distance
  metric and use it to devise an eÂ¡cient algorithm to jointly segment and align the
  two sequences. Our results demonstrate that this new measure of sequence similarity
  can lead to improved classification performance, while being resilient to noise,
  on a variety of problems, from EEG to motion sequence classification.
