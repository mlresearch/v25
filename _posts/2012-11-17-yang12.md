title: Practical Large Scale Classification with Additive Kernels
abstract: For classification problems with millions of training examples or dimensions,
  accuracy, training and testing speed and memory usage are the main concerns. Recent
  advances have allowed linear SVM to tackle problems with moderate time and space
  cost, but for many tasks in computer vision, additive kernels would have higher
  accuracies. In this paper, we propose the PmSVM-LUT algorithm that employs Look-Up
  Tables to boost the training and testing speed and save memory usage of additive
  kernel SVM classification, in order to meet the needs of large scale problems. The
  PmSVM-LUT algorithm is based on PmSVM (Wu,Â 2012), which employed polynomial approximation
  for the gradient function to speedup the dual coordinate descent method. We also
  analyze the polynomial approximation numerically to demonstrate its validity. Empirically,
  our algorithm is faster than PmSVM and feature mapping in many datasets with higher
  classification accuracies and can save up to 60\% memory usage as well.
