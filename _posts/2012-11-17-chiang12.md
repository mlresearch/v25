title: A Ranking-based KNN Approach for Multi-Label Classification
abstract: Multi-label classification has attracted a great deal of attention in recent
  years. This paper presents an interesting finding, namely, being able to identify
  neighbors with trustable labels can significantly improve the classification accuracy.
  Based on this finding, we propose a k-nearest-neighbor-based ranking approach to
  solve the multi-label classification problem. The approach exploits a ranking model
  to learn which neighborâ€™s labels are more trustable candidates for a weighted KNN-based
  strategy, and then assigns higher weights to those candidates when making weighted-voting
  decisions. The weights can then be determined by using a generalized pattern search
  technique. We collect several real-word data sets from various domains for the experiment.
  Our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art
  instance-based learning approaches. We believe that appropriately exploiting k-nearest
  neighbors is useful to solve the multi-label problem.
