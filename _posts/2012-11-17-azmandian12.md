title: Local Kernel Density Ratio-Based Feature Selection for Outlier Detection
abstract: Selecting features is an important step of any machine learning task, though
  most of the focus has been to choose features relevant for classification and regression.
  In this work, we present a novel non-parametric evaluation criterion for filter-based
  feature selection which enhances outlier detection. Our proposed method seeks the
  subset of features that represents the inherent characteristics of the normal dataset
  while forcing outliers to stand out, making them more easily distinguished by outlier
  detection algorithms. Experimental results on real datasets show the advantage of
  this feature selection algorithm compared to popular and state-of-the-art methods.
  We also show that the proposed algorithm is able to overcome the small sample space
  problem and perform well on highly imbalanced datasets.
