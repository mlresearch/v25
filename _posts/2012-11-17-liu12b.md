title: Key Instance Detection in Multi-Instance Learning
abstract: The goal of traditional multi-instance learning (MIL) is to predict the
  labels of the bags, whereas in many real applications, it is desirable to get the
  instance labels, especially the labels of key instances that trigger the bag labels,
  in addition to getting bag labels. Such a problem has been largely unexplored before.
  In this paper, we formulate the Key Instance Detection (KID) problem, and propose
  a voting framework (VF) solution to KID. The key of VF is to exploit the relationship
  among instances, represented by a citer kNN graph. This graph is different from
  commonly used nearest neighbor graphs, but is suitable for KID. Experiments validate
  the effectiveness of VF for KID. Additionally, VF also outperforms state-of-the-art
  MIL approaches on the performance of bag label prediction.
