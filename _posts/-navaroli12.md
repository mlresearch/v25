title: Statistical Models for Exploring Individual Email Communication Behavior
abstract: As digital communication devices play an increasingly prominent role in
  our daily lives, the ability to analyze and understand our communication patterns
  becomes more important. In this paper, we investigate a latent variable modeling
  approach for extracting information from individual email histories, focusing in
  particular on understanding how an individual communicates over time with recipients
  in their social network. The proposed model consists of latent groups of recipients,
  each of which is associated with a piecewise-constant Poisson rate over time. Inference
  of group memberships, temporal changepoints, and rate parameters is carried out
  via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We illustrate the utility of the model
  by applying it to both simulated and real-world email data sets.
