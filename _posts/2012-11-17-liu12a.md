title: A Convex-Concave Relaxation Procedure Based Subgraph Matching Algorithm
abstract: Based on the convex-concave relaxation procedure (CCRP), the (extended)
  path following algorithms were recently proposed to approximately solve the equal-sized
  graph matching problem, and exhibited a state-of-the-art performance (Zaslavskiy
  et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2012). However, they cannot be used for subgraph matching
  since either their convex or concave relaxation becomes no longer applicable. In
  this paper we extend the CCRP to tackle subgraph matching, by proposing a convex
  as well as a concave relaxation of the problem. Since in the context of CCRP, the
  convex relaxation can be viewed as an initialization of a concave programming, we
  introduce two other initializations for comparison. Meanwhile, the graduated assignment
  algorithm is also introduced in the experimental comparisons, which witness the
  validity of the proposed algorithm.
