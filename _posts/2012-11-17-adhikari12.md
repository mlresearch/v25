title: Multiresolution Mixture Modeling using Merging of Mixture Components
abstract: Observing natural phenomena at several levels of detail results in multiresolution
  data. Extending models and algorithms to cope with multiresolution data is a prerequisite
  for wide-spread exploitation of the data represented in the multiple resolutions.
  Mixture models are widely used probabilistic models, however, the mixture models
  in their standard form can be used to analyze the data represented in a single resolution.
  In this paper, we propose a multiresolution mixture model based on merging of the
  mixture components across models represented in different resolutions. Result of
  such an analysis scenario is to have multiple mixture models, one mixture model
  for each resolution of data. Our proposed solution is based on the idea on the interaction
  between mixture models. More specifically, we repeatedly merge component distributions
  of mixture models across different resolutions. We experiment our proposed algorithm
  on the two real-world chromosomal aberration datasets represented in two different
  resolutions. Results show an improvement on the compared multiresolution settings.
