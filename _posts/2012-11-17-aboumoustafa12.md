title: 'A Note on Metric Properties for Some Divergence Measures: The Gaussian Case'
abstract: Multivariate Gaussian densities are pervasive in pattern recognition and
  machine learning. A central operation that appears in most of these areas is to
  measure the difference between two multivariate Gaussians. Unfortunately, traditional
  measures based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the Bhattacharyya distance
  do not satisfy all metric axioms necessary for many algorithms. In this paper we
  propose a modification for the KL divergence and the Bhattacharyya distance, for
  multivariate Gaussian densities, that transforms the two measures into distance
  metrics. Next, we show how these metric axioms impact the unfolding process of manifold
  learning algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the efficacy of the proposed metrics
  on two different manifold learning algorithms when used for motion clustering in
  video data. Our results show that, in this particular application, the new proposed
  metrics lead to boosts in performance (at least 7%) when compared to other divergence
  measures.
