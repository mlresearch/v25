title: 'QBoost: Large Scale Classifier Training withAdiabatic Quantum Optimization'
abstract: We introduce a novel discrete optimization method for training in the context
  of a boosting framework for large scale binary classifiers. The motivation is to
  cast the training problem into the format required by existing adiabatic quantum
  hardware. First we provide theoretical arguments concerning the transformation of
  an originally continuous optimization problem into one with discrete variables of
  low bit depth. Next we propose QBoost as an iterative training algorithm in which
  a subset of weak classifiers is selected by solving a hard optimization problem
  in each iteration. A strong classifier is incrementally constructed by concatenating
  the subsets of weak classifiers. We supplement the findings with experiments on
  one synthetic and two natural data sets and compare against the performance of existing
  boosting algorithms. Finally, by conducting a quantum Monte Carlo simulation we
  gather evidence that adiabatic quantum optimization is able to handle the discrete
  optimization problems generated by QBoost.
