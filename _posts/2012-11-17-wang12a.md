title: Spatial Locality-Aware Sparse Coding and Dictionary Learning
abstract: Nonlinear encoding of SIFT features has recently shown good promise in image
  classification. This scheme is able to reduce the training complexity of the traditional
  bag-of-feature approaches while achieving better performance. As a result, it is
  suitable for large-scale image classification applications. However, existing nonlinear
  encoding methods do not explicitly consider the spatial relationship when encoding
  the local features, but merely leaving the spatial information used at a later stage,
  e.g. through the spatial pyramid matching, is largely inadequate. In this paper,
  we propose a joint sparse coding and dictionary learning scheme that take the spatial
  information into consideration in encoding. Our experiments on synthetic data and
  benchmark data demonstrate that the proposed scheme can learn a better dictionary
  and achieve higher classification accuracy.
