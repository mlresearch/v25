title: Max-Margin Ratio Machine
abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of exploiting global information
  to improve the performance of SVMs on large scale classification problems. We first
  present a unified general framework for the existing min-max machine methods in
  terms of within-class dispersions and between-class dispersions. By defining a new
  within-class dispersion measure, we then propose a novel max-margin ratio machine
  (MMRM) method that can be formulated as a linear programming problem with scalability
  for large data sets. Kernels can be easily incorporated into our method to address
  non-linear classification problems. Our empirical results show that the proposed
  MMRM approach achieves promising results on large data sets.
